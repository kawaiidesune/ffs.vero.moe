# My FFS Packing List
This is what I took with me when I went to see Dr. Zukowski for FFS. This was all packed into [a Red Oxx CPA Briefcase](https://www.redoxx.com/Briefcases-and-Garment-Bags/CPA-Briefcase/91096/130/Product) and [a Red Oxx Sky Train](https://www.redoxx.com/sky-train/91019/product). All 100% carry-on legal. If you're curious about how I prepared for my return to Colorado, here's how I [prepared my home](/homeprep.html) for my return.

## Clothing

## Electronics
* Apple Watch
* Headphones - I have a pair of Skullcandy headphones that seem to work wonders for me.
* iPhone - For selfies and staying in touch.
* Laptop - Yeah, my 2013 Retina MacBook Pro has seen better days, but at least it can play The Sims 4 and it does have a TON of music.

## Health & Beauty
Given the fact that I have long hair and the small amounts of shampoo that TSA will let you carry on a plane, I decided it would be best to buy my shampoo in Chicago.
* Breath strips
* Comb
* Dilators
* Glasses
* Glasses case
* Hairbrush
* Medication (specifically, Estradiol and Medroxyprogesterone)
* Nail kit - I actually have a portable nail kit that I bought from Amazon for my every day carry, and it works pretty well.
* Thermometer - I have a Withings Thermo which seems to work great and is very compact.
* Vitamins - Having had bariatric surgery, I will need to take vitamins for the rest of my life. So, with that in mind, I packed my supply of Bariatric Advantage Multi EA and Bariatric Advantage Calcium Citrate Chewy Bite vitamins.

## Office/Documentation
* Airline ticket receipts - While I do keep a digital record on Evernote and apps like that, sometimes it is good to have a paper record as a backup.
* The FFS Binder - Yes, that binder that Dr. Zukowski mentions.
* Hotel receipts - Same as the airline ticket receipts.
