# Preparing For My Return Home
Because I would be away for 10 days, I wanted to make sure I didn't have anything that would expire while I was in Chicago. So, also as a reward for covering for me while I went to Chicago, I made a lot of French food for my coworkers.

## Home Stocking List

### Food & Drink
* Milk. In addition to the fat-free variety, I also made sure to buy a couple of big bottles of my favourite chocolate milk, [Promised Land 2% Midnight Chocolate Milk](http://www.promisedlanddairy.com/products_items/reduced-fat-midnight-chocolate-milk/)!

### Health / Beauty.
* Aloe vera gel. As someone who sunburns easily and living close to a mile above sea level, I try to make sure I never lack Aloe vera but one can never be too careful.
